# author: Rion Dooley <dooley@tacc.utexas.edu>
#
# This is a basic Docker Compose file to start the beanstalkd console webapp and a
# fully functional beanstalkd instance in a single command. The beanstalkd server
# is accessible on standard port 11300. The beanstalkd console is available at
# http://<your docker host>:9080.
#
# By default, a new image will be built from the the source code in this repository.
# You may also skip the build step and use the public, automated build of this
# repository by commenting out the build argument and uncommenting the image argument.
#
# If you need a persistent beanstalkd binlog, simply uncomment the last 5 lines.
